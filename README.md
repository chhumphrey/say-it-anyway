# Say It Anyway: Grief Journal

Say It Anyway: Grief Journal is a private, offline-first journaling app designed to give people a gentle place to write when there are things left unsaid.

The app allows users to create recipient profiles for loved ones and write personal notes over time. Messages are stored locally on the device and remain completely private. There are no accounts, no tracking, and no data is transmitted or shared.

Say It Anyway is intentionally simple and calm. It does not analyze entries, provide feedback, or attempt to guide the user’s emotions. It exists solely as a personal space for reflection, remembrance, and expression, at the user’s own pace.

For moments when someone may want additional help, the app includes optional links to publicly available support resources. These resources are informational only and are always accessible without restriction.

Say It Anyway: Grief Journal does not provide medical, mental health, or professional advice. It is intended as a personal writing tool for reflection and remembrance.

Why This App Exists

Grief often leaves people with thoughts, memories, or messages that have nowhere to go. Conversations end, routines change, and there can be a lingering sense that something was left unfinished.

This app exists to offer a quiet space for those moments — not to fix them, interpret them, or explain them, but simply to hold them.

Say It Anyway was created with the belief that writing can be meaningful even when there is no response, no audience, and no outcome. It is designed to stay out of the way, respect privacy completely, and allow users to return whenever they need, for as long as they need.

There is no pressure to write often, write well, or write with any particular purpose. The app exists only to make space.
